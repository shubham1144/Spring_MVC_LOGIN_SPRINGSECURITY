# Spring_MVC_LOGIN
login example using spring mvc +maven project+ spring security(using authenticationprovider)
created a sample application using spring security version 3.2.4 !!!!i am currently using a custom authenticationprovider to grant authorities to the user!!!
concepts coverred:spring security,context-property,pom.xml file requirements,grantiing a user a authority,how controller works ,security tags based on roles!!!


user logs in->validated->user is shown user tab,admin is shown admin tab!!!
what is nice about this??both the user and the admin are redirected to the same page but the content shown to each of them is different!!!
